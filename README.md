# Allow2WP

This is the first demo project for the Allow2 Web Service.

It is a time-control system for Wordpress websites.

It provides a concrete example of how to perform a full-featured integration with the Allow2 service via the Allow2 Web Service API.

The intention, by open-sourcing, is to:

1. Accelerate development,
2. Provide an example for integration into web services, and
3. To act as a base for porting to any other web service or language (and any other systems as required). 

Note that all Allow2 API/SDK and other open-source components are subject to the same permissive use license as detailed in LICENSE.md
