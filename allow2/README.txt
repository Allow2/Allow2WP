Allow2 Parental Freedom Platform

The Allow2 WordPress plugin is a simple plug and play drop in component that empowers your site to offer full parental freedom.

== Description ==
Allow2 provides comprehensive parental freedom for free.

Add this plugin and every account on your site can be linked to the Allow2 Parental Freedom Platform.

Why would you want this?

75% of US families try to impose restrictions on electronic devices and internet, so NOT providing this capability reduces your potential users.

Parents are under attack from every angle with technology. Everyone is so scared of screen time addiction and overuse of social networks and addictive gaming that they are simply spending less and saying \"no\". They don\'t have the time or energy (nor the knowledge or desire) to fight with this barrage, so they simply avoid the problem by NOT using games and sites that do not provide the controls they need.

Our mission is to remove fear and friction in the home. By providing comprehensive and powerful parental controls, we remove the fear and time overheads, and allow parents to purchase more gamed, allow social account creation and relax with messaging with no guilt.

If your site wants more members, then provide the controls parents want to remove the barrier to entry. Let them feel safe and boost your numbers, both directly and by increasing referrals.

== Installation ==
1) Install and Enable the plugin
2) Log in to https://developer.allow2.com (create a free account) and create a \"service\", using the redirect and webhook urls provided when you installed the plugin on your site.
3) Enter the supplied id and token credentials in the plugin configuration to authorise the connection.

When you create the service in your Allow2 developer account, name it according to your web site name to allow Parents to identify the website when they connect the account.
